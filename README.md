Adding React Components

To add a new React component, create a new file in the src/components/ directory. You can then import and use the component in your .astro files or other React components.

Example:

jsx
Copy code
// src/components/ExampleComponent.jsx
export default function ExampleComponent() {
  return <div className="p-4 bg-blue-500 text-white">Hello, World!</div>;
}
Use it in an Astro page:
